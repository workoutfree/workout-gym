Just get your body moving out of the strict planes that weightlifting keeps it in. The beauty of hiit training is you don’t have to do it every day. Hiit isn&#39;t &#39;better&#39; for weight loss, its just better for some people because it cuts down on the time required to achieve a thorough workout. Hiit is intense, and beginners are less likely to stick with super intense programs, and with higher intensity comes a greater risk of injury.
