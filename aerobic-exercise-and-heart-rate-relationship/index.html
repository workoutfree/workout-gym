The aerobic heart rate zone is zone. In general, resting heart rate (measured in beats per minute, or bpm) usually will measure somewhere between the 60’s to 100 bpm. The first dash point for the immediate physiological responses to training is heart rate. Heart rate can also be taken manually on your wrist or neck—simply count the number of beats in 15.
