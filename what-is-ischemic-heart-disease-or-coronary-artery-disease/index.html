Ischemic heart disease is also known as coronary artery disease or hardening of the arteries. cholesterol plaque can build up in the arteries of the heart and cause ischemia, which means the heart is not getting enough blood flow and oxygen. It may be chronic, narrowing of the coronary artery over time and limiting of the blood supply to part of the muscle. This process is called atherosclerosis. In ischemic cm, the heart&#39;s ability to pump blood is decreased because the heart&#39;s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, is enlarged, dilated and weak.
