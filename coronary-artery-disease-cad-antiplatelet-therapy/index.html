Oral Antiplatelet Therapy in Cerebrovascular Disease, Coronary Artery From jamanetwork.com
Use of antiplatelet therapy has shown to reduce the occurrence of vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and death. Intensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a p2y 12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of dapt, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff. Antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing cabg e68. The recently published compass (cardiovascular outcomes for people using anticoagulation strategies) trial compared standard antiplatelet therapy with low‐dose aspirin (100 mg/day) vs rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin or rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily in 27 395 patients with stable coronary artery disease (cad) and/or pad.
