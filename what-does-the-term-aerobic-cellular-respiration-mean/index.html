Each process produces different amounts of energy and has different benefits and drawbacks. It is a less efficient form of respiration than aerobic respiration, as a very low amount of. When cells break down sugars and other elements to generate energy in the lack of or deprivation of oxygen, it is called anaerobic respiration. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food.

This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Aerobic respiration is the aerobic catabolism of nutrients to carbon dioxide, water, and energy, and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor.

<p>Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. When cells break down sugars and other elements to generate energy in the lack of or deprivation of oxygen, it is called anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the aerobic catabolism of nutrients to carbon dioxide, water, and energy, and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor. This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. What does aerobic respiration produce? Quora.</p>
