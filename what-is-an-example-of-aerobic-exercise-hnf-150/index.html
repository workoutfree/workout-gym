Protein shakes are the best fluids to support physical activity because it rapidly leaves the digestive tract to enter the tissues, and it cools the body from the inside out. This enhances muscle strength and endurance, generating hypertrophy. Aerobic exercises are sustained and rhythmic activities involving large muscle groups that challenge the lungs and heart, as oxygen is required in large amounts for these exercises. Examples of aerobic exercises include cardio machines, spinning, running, swimming, walking, hiking, aerobics classes, dancing, cross country skiing, and kickboxing.
