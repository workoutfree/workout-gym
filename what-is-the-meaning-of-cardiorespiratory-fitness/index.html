Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is defined as the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to deliver oxygen to the mitochondria of the skeletal muscle in order to generate the energy required for physical activity during exercise. It measures how much your heart and blood vessels transport blood during working out. The more efficient and effective your body becomes at doing that, the longer you can. High rates of cvd have been observed in the schizophrenia population, translating into a markedly reduced life expectancy as compared to healthy.

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy production needed during physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. The crf is a crucial indicator of physical and mental health, as well as academic success, in children.</p>
