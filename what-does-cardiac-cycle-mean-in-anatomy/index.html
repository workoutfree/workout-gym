<p>The process begins as early as the 4th gestational week when the heart first begins contracting. Following are the different phases that occur in a cardiac cycle: One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive. The cardiac cycle is defined as the time from the end of one heart contraction to the end of the subsequent contraction and consists of a period of relaxation called diastole followed by a period of contraction called systole.</p>

<p>The filling of the ventricle (diastole) is followed by ventricular contraction (systole) to provide an adequate cardiac output during both rest and exercise to meet the body's metabolic demands. At this phase, blood cells flow from. The cardiovascular system involves systemic and pulmonary circulation and is responsible for the transport of various substances in human beings, and is composed of the heart, arteries, veins, and blood capillaries. A contraction event (of either the atria or ventricles) is referred to as systole, and a relaxation event is referred to as diastole.

<p>The heartâs primary function is to circulate blood throughout the body in a cycle.every day, the human heart beats around 100,000 times. The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle.

<p>The period of contraction of the heart chamber and blood is pumped out of the heart. The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole. There is an inverse relationship between the duration of cardiac cycle and heart rate.

<p>These two phases are subdivided into seven phases. Duration of cardiac cycle depends on the heart rate per minute. Humans have double circulation i.e the blood follows through two pathways 1. It has its own circulation system and receives electric impulses that make it contract and relax, which triggers a sequence of events forming the cardiac cycle.
