How can the heart increase cardiac output? Socratic From socratic.org
To meet this increased demand, your heart will pump blood through your body faster, resulting in an increased heart rate. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. From there it is absorbed into the bloodstream.
