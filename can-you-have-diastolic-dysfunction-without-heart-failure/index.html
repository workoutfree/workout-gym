Grade 1 is a mild condition that can also be termed as the early stage of diastolic dysfunction. Abnormalities in diastolic function can occur in the presence or absence of a clinical syndrome of heart failure and with normal or abnormal systolic function. As with many cardiovascular conditions, advancing age is one of the primary causes of diastolic heart failure. “the heart becomes less efficient at.
