1 Stomach From pt.slideshare.net
This sphincter prevents the acidic contents of the stomach from moving. Cardiac sphincter, working with the pyloric sphincter keeps the stomach content from moving elsewhere. Also known as the lower esophageal sphincter, it opens and allows the food to enter the stomach. The contents of the stomach are highly acidic and can burn the esophagus, which is what causes the symptoms of heartburn.
