Insulin Secretion and Glucose During Exercise With and Without From diabetes.diabetesjournals.org
Resistance exercise like moderate weightlifting is fine, but you should avoid power exercises like competitive weight lifting. Blood glucose, commonly known as blood sugar, is the amount of sugar in blood at any given time. Sometimes, especially with very vigorous exercise such as weight lifting, the opposite may happen and blood glucose may climb too high. The pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon.

<p>The effects of exercise don’t stop just because the physical activity or exercise is over. The interaction between insulin and exercise is an example of balancing and modifying the effects of two opposing metabolic regulatory forces under varying conditions. Insulin helps move glucose into cells. Blood glucose, commonly known as blood sugar, is the amount of sugar in blood at any given time.

<p>The hormones glucagon and insulin are secreted by the pancreas during periods of low or high blood sugar, respectively. Sometimes, especially with very vigorous exercise such as weight lifting, the opposite may happen and blood glucose may climb too high. Some people only need to reduce their insulin a little, some need to reduce it by as much as half. Both hormones work in balance to play a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels.

<p>This is important because if exercise was associated with an increase in insulin, the plasma glucose would be taken. A peptide hormone produced by the pancreas, insulin regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism. The glycemic response depends very much on the type and intensity of the exercise, together with the level of insulin in the blood prior to the exercise. While insulin is secreted after food intake and is the primary hormone increasing glucose storage as glycogen and fatty acid storage as triglycerides, exercise is a condition where fuel stores need to be mobilized and oxidized.

<p>Both hormones work in balance to play a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels. However, (such as between meals, and during exercise) more and more glucagon is secreted.
