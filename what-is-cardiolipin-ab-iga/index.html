<p>Measurement of igg, igm and iga cardiolipin autoantibodies (acl) by eia is the standard procedure for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (apl) in patients with suspected antiphospholipid syndrome. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. If there is a clotting issue that is known, then the negative result indicates that there is another reason behind the blood clots that are occurring.
