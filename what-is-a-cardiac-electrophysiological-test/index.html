If you have an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), cardiologists can use an electrophysiologic study (eps) to find out what part of the heart is causing this change in rhythm and what medicines will work best to bring that rhythm back to normal. Electrophysiological testing of the heart is the test carried out to check the electrical activities generated by the heart. A cardiac electrophysiologist is a cardiologist who has 2 years of extra training to learn about heart rhythms and how to diagnose problems with. This booklet describes the special tests that are commonly used to help diagnose heart diseases.

<p>An electrophysiology (ep) study — also called invasive cardiac electrophysiology — is a series of tests that examine the heart's electrical activity. Cardiac electrophysiology is a specialized procedure in which one or more thin, flexible wires, called catheters are inserted into a blood vessel (usually the groin) and guided into the heart. Some of the tests are also used to assess the current condition of people who have already been diagnosed with heart disease. An electrophysiological study (ep study) is a test used to evaluate your heart's electrical system and to check for abnormal heart rhythms. Electrophysiology (EP) Study HERC Publishing.</p>

<p>This movement of the heart creates the heartbeat, or heart rhythm. An electrophysiological (ep) study is a test which looks at your heart's electrical activity in more detail. If you have an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), cardiologists can use an electrophysiologic study (eps) to find out what part of the heart is causing this change in rhythm and what medicines will work best to bring that rhythm back to normal.
