Benefits of Short Bouts of Cardio in the Corporate Fitness Center From wellness.nifs.org
A research published in the american journal of physiology found that 30 minutes of daily exercise is equally as efficient for weight loss as 60 minutes. The world health organization recommends that whatever type of cardio exercise you choose to do, you should do. If you burn between 80 and 300 calories per day via exercise, losing one pound of body fat will take anywhere from 10 days to more than a month utilizing a regimen that simply includes 20 minutes of activity every day. So, you don&#39;t have to worry about being too active for 20 minutes and then becoming inactive for the rest of the day.
