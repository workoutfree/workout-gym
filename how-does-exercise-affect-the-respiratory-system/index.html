PPT Diseases of Respiratory System PowerPoint Presentation ID2097453 From slideserve.com
As exercise intensity increases, greater demands are placed on the respiratory muscles, making them work harder on inspiration (inhale) and expiration (exhale). Increasing your lung capacity will help you breathe easier even when working out reducing shortness of breath. The skeletal muscles that control respiration include your diaphragm and intercostals. The respiratory system provides oxygen to be transported through the blood to the exercising muscles as well as eliminating carbon dioxide.
