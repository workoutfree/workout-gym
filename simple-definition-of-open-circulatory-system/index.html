The blood is called haemolymph and the tissues through which the blood flows is called haemocoel. In open circulatory system there is no difference between the blood and interstitial fluid (fluid inside the cells). An arrangement of internal transport in which blood bathes the organs directly and there is no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid. While arteries carry blood away from the heart, the veins (in most cases) carry blood back to the heart.

<p>The blood in the body flows through a system of arteries, veins and capillaries. The open circulatory system is the distinct feature of arthropods and mollusks (except squids and octopuses), where they possess dorsal blood vessel. This type of circulation is called closed circulation. Open circulatory systems are the more basic type of circulatory system.</p>

<p>In this type of circulatory system, the blood pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses. Humans have a closed circulatory system, while many mollusks and other invertebrates have an open system. Looking at the issue from the other side, our standard view of a closed circulatory system is based on a system where a multichambered muscular heart pumps blood through parallel systemic and pulmonary circuits simultaneously (figure 1(c)). Many segmented crustaceans have an open circulatory system. The Circulatory System.</p>

<p>The open circulatory system is where the hemolymph flows in the organs and tissues directly. The blood is pumped by the heart and passes through the large vessels into large cavities or sinuses. The major difference between the open and closed circulatory system is the way blood flows in an organism. Open circulatory systems are systems where blood, rather than being sealed tight in arteries and veins, suffuses the body and may be directly open to the environment at places such as the digestive tract. 5G Circulatory system YouTube.</p>
