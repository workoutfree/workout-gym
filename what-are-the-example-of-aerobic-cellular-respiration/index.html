Cellular Respiration THE PHYS ED EXPRESS From thephysedexpress.com
The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. Oxidation of carbohydrates using oxygen for producing energy during aerobic respiration for humans. Biochemically, aerobic cellular respiration is defined as the process of metabolizing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp) from a series of redox reactions involving glucose sugar. The anaerobic respiration occurs in lower groups of organisms like bacteria, fungi, etc.

<p>Aerobic respiration is the aerobic catabolism of nutrients to carbon dioxide, water, and energy, and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Aerobic respiration is the process by which the energy from glucose is released in the presence of oxygen. This oxygen molecule is then used for cellular respiration and the produced byproduct then also released in the water. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. Aerobic Cellular Respiration YouTube.</p>
