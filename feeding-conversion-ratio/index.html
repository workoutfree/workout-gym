Feed conversion ratio refers to the measure of how efficiently. Feed conversion ratio sheep and goat have an average fcr of 4.5 on high concentrate feed, 5.5 on good quality forage and about 30 on straw ration. Boyd discusses the feed conversion ratio and the benefits of reducing it, which include less feed waste, improved water quality, improved fifo and reduced oxygen demand. The feed conversion is 4,960 pounds of feed divided by 3,100 pounds of net fish production which equals 1.6.

The feed conversion ratio is a metric used to assess an animalâs production and efficiency. Secara matematis, fcr dapat dinyatakan sebagai konsumsi pakan dibagi dengan berat yang diperoleh.

<p>Efficient conversion of feed to biomass is the quintessential feature of a properly managed aquaculture facility. Measurement of epi is performed by calculating the total value of fish produced minus the total feed costs. Feed conversion ratio (fcr) is simply defined as the mathematical relationship between the feed an animal consumes and the weight that the animal gains by consuming the feed. If the fcr is 2.0 then it takes 2 kg of feed to take a pig from 30 to 31 kg liveweight for example, as opposed to a 3.0 ratio where it takes 3 kg of feed to achieve the same 1 kg of body weight gain and the associated higher feed bill.
