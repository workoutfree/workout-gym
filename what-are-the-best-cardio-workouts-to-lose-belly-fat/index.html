Burn Belly Fat Fast &amp; Lose Weight With This HIIT Cardio Workout (No From onlinefitnessgym.com
Cardio isn&#39;t the fastest way to lose belly fat. When it comes to achieving a weight loss goal (and more specifically reductions in belly fat), we know that balancing our stress hormone, cortisol, is an extremely important factor to consider.(1) depending on the type of cardio you&#39;re doing, some exercises will help lower your cortisol, while others will temporarily spike your cortisol but ultimately help bring it back down. Once you start incrementing the difficulty, make sure you account for your current fitness level and experience, as this step will look different for everyone. Cardio provides the metabolism boost you need while you are exercising and continues to work for a bit after.
