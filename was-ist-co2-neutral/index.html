Well, when a person, company or country says they are “carbon neutral”, it means they’ve reduced the amount of carbon dioxide they’re responsible for releasing into the earth’s atmosphere, as much as they can. Because it is produced from such organically derived resources as animal fats and vegetable oil it can be used to recycle a wide range. To achieve this, you have to balance carbon emissions with carbon removal. As part of this, un climate change launched climate.
