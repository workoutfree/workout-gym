Simple Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Diagram AflamNeeeak From aflam-neeeak.blogspot.com
The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. The respiration which uses oxygen is called aerobic respiration. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Aerobic respiration is the process of producing cellular energy involving oxygen.

<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. It produces a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (atp), which exists in all living tissues.
