Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps.
