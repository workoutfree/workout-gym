This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. The body has different ways of creating energy and using energy.

<p>This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). Aerobic capacity is an index of the adaptive ability of large striated muscles to work by using energy from aerobic metabolism. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.vÌo 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity.
