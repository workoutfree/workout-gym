What Is The Difference Between Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration From slidesharenow.blogspot.com
Anaerobic exercise is brief, strenuous, or intense exercise, not powered by oxygen burning, that last only a short period of time. Human sex (final exam review) 45 terms. The word “aerobic” means “with oxygen,” as this kind of exercise is fueled by the oxygen that.
