<p>Not only will you have more energy and stamina for work, sports, and everyday activities, but your psychological wellbeing and heart health will. Cardiac troponin t levels remain elevated for at least seven days after a heart attack, which is much longer than after prolonged exercise.

<p>Cardiac troponin t levels remain elevated for at least seven days after a heart attack, which is much longer than after prolonged exercise. The positive effects of regular cardio training are scientifically proven and they also help build muscle indirectly. In fact, few investigations have focused on the effect of endurance training duration on muscle hypertrophy at a molecular level. It is well established that endurance exercise training is an effective way to improve muscle oxygen supply by increasing cd and captor in healthy subjects and also in pathophysiological conditions.
