<meta name="description" content="Incredible Examples Of Heart Rate After Exercise For Weight Loss, The children’s heart rate was probably close to its maximum after 4 minutes of exercise, so it would not increase by much if the children exercised for a longer time. A prolonged elevated heart rate after exercise, as confirmed by a slow heart rate recovery, suggests you may be at higher risk of metabolic syndrome or heart problems, but factors like dehydration, excessive fatigue, and stress can affect the results too.

The more active the exercise, the faster the heart rate (up to a maximum). Your target heart rate zone is a percentage of your maximum heart rate: Say you run for 30 minutes at an average heart rate of 155 beats per minute and your heart rate. Although being overweight can affect the rate in which the heart rate goes back to the resting heart rate.
