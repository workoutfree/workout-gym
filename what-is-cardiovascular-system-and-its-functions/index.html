The human circulatory system consists of a network of arteries, veins, and capillaries, with the heart pumping blood through it. The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The function of the cardiovascular system include keeping our bodies at a constant temperature, maintaining fluid balance throughout the tissues, protecting the body from blood loss and infection, and helping move waste products out of the body. On the other hand, blood also cleans the body by collecting waste products like carbon dioxide.
