Thrombosis and fetal loss is the main symptom for the reference of the anti cardiolipin igg antibody. Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus.

There are different classes (isotypes) of anticardiolipin antibody, namely igg, igm, and iga. Anticardiolipin and Antinuclear Antibodies in Patients with Unexplained.</p>

<p>A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages.

<p>There are different classes (isotypes) of anticardiolipin antibody, namely igg, igm, and iga. The number of patients with elevated igg acl was significantly higher among patients with bcs and cirrhosis, compared with controls (p = 0.03 and p = 0.002, respectively). One can test for all isotypes at once, or they can be detected separately. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur.
