The healthcare provider puts this tube through a large vein. The right pulmonary artery is one of the branches of the pulmonary trunk, branching at the level of the transthoracic plane of ludwig. Pulmonary artery catheterization uses a catheter that has an inflatable balloon at its tip. Interventional radiologists should be familiar with minimally invasive procedures used to treat various abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries.
