This energy system can extend out work for hours or sometimes days. A better way to train. aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity.

<p>Firstly, make the run more continuous. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while youâre training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. If we try to train speed without having the aerobic efficiency to keep it up, we will end up having to stop or slow down, thus making it unusable speed for an endurance event, says ryan chow , doctor of.

<p>These physiological pathways are called energy systems, and the most important of these for endurance athletes is the aerobic energy system.letâs take a closer look at how your body utilizes the aerobic system to power you on your bike, and how you can train this system to be more. Commonly known as vo2 max, it is useful for the running coach to determine what velocity is associated with present day aerobic power development in an athlete at that moment in time. Itâs a lot more complicated than this, but in essence, think of the aerobic system as using oxygen as its primary fuel source. Maximal aerobic speed (mas) is simply the lowest running speed at which maximum oxygen uptake (v0 2 max) occurs, and is typically referred to as the velocity at v0 2 max (vv0 2 max).

<p>Once the vvo2 max is determined it can be used to structure aerobic training loads and intensities.

Aerobic training should be done at least 3 times a week, at an intensity between 70% and 80% of their maximum heart rate, and normally goes for 30+min in duration.
