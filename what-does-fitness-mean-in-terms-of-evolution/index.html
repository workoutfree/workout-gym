(4 days ago) apr 18, 2013 · best answer. Fitness is a measure of how well organisms survive and reproduce with emphasis on “reproduce.” officially fitness is defined as the number of offspring that organisms with a particular genotype or phenotype leave behind on average as compared to others in the population. What does fitness mean in terms of evolution? Crossing over and independent assortment.
