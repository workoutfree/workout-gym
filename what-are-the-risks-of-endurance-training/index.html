According to new research in the journal medicine &amp; science in sports &amp; exercise, regular endurance training may counteract the harmful effects of sitting for long periods of time. In general, this type of exercise training refers to any type of activity that trains the aerobic energy system as opposed to the anaerobic energy system. Anyone can endurance train, but typically this form of exercise can be used by athletes or people looking to lose weight. People with genetic risk factors are especially vulnerable.
