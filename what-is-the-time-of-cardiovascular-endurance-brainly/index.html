Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to your body tissues. This shows how efficiently your cardiorespiratory system functions, and is an indicator of how physically fit and healthy you are. Cardiovascular endurance is how efficiently your heart, blood vessels, and lungs to supply oxygen rich blood to working muscles during physical activity (aerobic activity like running, walking, cycling or playing a sport) for a prolonged period of time or for more than 90 seconds. Exercise at the highest possible average heart rate for the session, irrespective of exercise type.
