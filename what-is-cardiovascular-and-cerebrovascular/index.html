A cerebrovascular disease is one caused by arteries blocked by a blood clot, bleeding in or around the brain caused by a ruptured blood vessel, and any change in the brain’s blood vessels that alters the normal flow of blood. Restrictions in blood flow may occur from vessel narrowing (stenosis), clot formation (thrombosis), blockage (embolism) or blood vessel rupture (hemorrhage). Although secondary cardiovascular prevention is a focus among patients with type 2 diabetes (t2d) and coronary artery disease (cad) or peripheral artery disease (pad), the application of guideline recommended therapy in t2d patients and isolated cerebrovascular disease (cevd) remains unknown. Lack of sufficient blood flow (ischemia.

<p>The meaning of cerebrovascular is of or involving the cerebrum and the blood vessels supplying it. Death of a part of the brain may lead to loss of certain body functions controlled by that affected part. When your cardiovascular system is working right, the cells in your body get a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients from your blood. It occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is suddenly stopped and oxygen cannot get to that part.</p>
