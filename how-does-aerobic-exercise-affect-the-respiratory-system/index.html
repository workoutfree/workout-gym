Ks4 respiration From slideshare.net
During exercise, acid is produced and body temperature increases as oxygen is removed from. The body responds to the stress of exercise or physical activity in a variety of ways. How does the cardiovascular system and respiratory system interrelate? An increase in the ‘respiration or breathing rate’ which refers to how many times a person completes an inhalation and exhalation every minute.

<p>The human respiratory system is adapted to allow air to pass in and out of the body, and for efficient gas exchange to happen. The more oxygen you take in — the more you exercise your lungs, and the stronger they get. As exercise intensity increases, greater demands are placed on the respiratory muscles, making them work harder on inspiration (inhale) and expiration (exhale). When your activity level changes, your body has to respond by making changes to your respiratory system. 👍 Cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise.</p>
