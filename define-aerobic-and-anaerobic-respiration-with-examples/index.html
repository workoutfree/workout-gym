The result is the formation of two molecules of pyruvate or pyruvic acid (c 3 h 4 or 3) which, in turn, feed other metabolic. Most of the plant and animal cells use aerobic respiration. There is a gas exchange in anaerobic respiration, but oxygen gas is not present. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen.

<p>Different types of respiration can also depend. Another key difference is the fact that higher organisms have aerobic respiration whereas in lower organisms anaerobic respiration occurs. There is a gas exchange in anaerobic respiration, but oxygen gas is not present. Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules. Aerobic Respiration Definition, Equation Steps, Examples, Formula.</p>

<p>The difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is: More energy (atp) is produced. Anaerobic respiration is the metabolic process in which oxygen is absent, and only the stage of glycolysis is completed.

<p>The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. This process is utilized in the making of bread, wine, beer and ethanol fuels. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts.

<p>However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. When cells break down sugars and other elements to generate energy in the lack of or deprivation of oxygen, it is called anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts.
