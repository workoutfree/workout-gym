<p>As humans age, the brainâs ability to process information with speed and efficiency steadily declines. Regular exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, and we hypothesize that this occurs through beneficial adaptations in vascular physiology and improved neurovascular coupling. It can improve memory and reduce anxiety or depression. Cardio exercise can result in new cell growth and improved memory.</p>
