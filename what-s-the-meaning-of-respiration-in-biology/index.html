<p>Organisms make use of such energy for their activities by oxidising these high energy food molecules into simple low energy molecules, i.e., carbon dioxide and water. Respiration is the biochemical process in exchange of gases and using oxygen to oxidize suitable substrate to release energy for metabolic processes. What is the simple definition of respiration? It produces carbon dioxide and water (waste products) and energy! What is photosynthesis? Updated 2021 Definition.</p>

<p>We know that during photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, and is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as glucose and starch. As we have learned in our article on photosynthesis, cells cannot directly use glucose as a source of energy. It produces carbon dioxide and water (waste products) and energy! This energy usually drives the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell. AP Biology The stages of cellular respiration, Ch. 7.</p>
