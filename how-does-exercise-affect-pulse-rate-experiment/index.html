<meta name="description" content="Simple How Does Exercise Affect Pulse Rate Experiment Just Simple Step, With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate. Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat — which means it doesn&#39;t have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise.

<p>This means the heart beats fewer. So your heart rate will still rise with exercise, but it won't have to rise as much. Whilst doing exercise there is an increase in respiration, this means that the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood will also increase as the oxygen is used up.

<p>How does exercise affect heart rate and recovery time? The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. When you are exercising, your muscles need extra oxygen—some three times as much as resting muscles. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Effect Of Exercise On Breathing Rate Experiment Rating Walls.</p>
