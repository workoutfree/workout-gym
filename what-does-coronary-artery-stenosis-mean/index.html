In the majority of adult cases the etiology is. Even if it doesn&#39;t progress, mild narrowing is a sign of early blood vessel disease and calls for preventive measures. Carotid artery stenosis (cas), atherosclerotic narrowing of the extracranial carotid arteries, is clinically significant because cas is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, which affects more than 600,000 american adults each year. And their coronary cta was used to analyze plaque composition and assess grading of stenosis.
