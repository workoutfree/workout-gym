The cardiovascular system also has to adapt to physical exercise, the impact of which relates to several issues related to the heart and blood vessel. Correspondingly, how does aerobic exercise affect the circulatory system? Elasticity is the definition of a healthy artery. It is due to the ability of exercise to changes in the concentration of co2 and o2 in the blood.
