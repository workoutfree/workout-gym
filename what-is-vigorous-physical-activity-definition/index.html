That is why i will define vigorous physical activity in an easy to understand way and share types of vigorous physical activity that your kids can do. Understanding the difference between intensity levels is important to understanding the current physical activity guidelines for americans. Moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (mvpa) is commonly recommended for health benefits (tremblay et al., 2011), yet the majority of the population does not engage in physical activity of sufficient intensity and volume (warburton et al., 2007; That is why i will define vigorous physical activity in an easy to understand way and share types of vigorous physical activity that your kids can do.

<p>Light intensity activities require the least amount of effort, compared to moderate and vigorous activities. Exercise can be organized into three categories: An exercise heart rate of 70 percent of maximum heart rate for age is about 60 percent of maximal cardiorespiratory capacity and is sufficient for cardiorespiratory conditioning. Rhythmic, repetitive physical activities that use large muscle groups at 70 percent or more of maximum heart rate for age.</p>
