<p>Aerobic endurance is the body’s ability to sustain medium to high intensity physical exercise for extended periods of time through the continual acquasition of oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Continuous ‘steady state’ exercise is performed aerobically. The term aerobic actually means with oxygen, which means that breathing controls the amount of oxygen that can make it to the muscles to help them burn fuel and move.</p>
