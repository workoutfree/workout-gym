<p>For example, the presence of a speckled positive ana indicates the presence of these specific autoantibodies, ssa, ssb, rnp, smith, and ku antibodies. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages.
