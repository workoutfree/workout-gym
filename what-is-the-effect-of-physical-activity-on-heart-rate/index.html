Exercise and CVD From slideshare.net
We will use a digital heart rate monitor strapped on our chest while we perform different levels of exercise. In our experiment the test subject needed more oxygen while exercising. The adaptability of the heart can be observed during exercise, when the metabolic activity of skeletal muscle tissue increases. Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds.

<p>Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. To investigate, how diabetes affect a person’s heart rate during physical exercise. As physical exercise increases, sympathetic nerves stimulate the heart to beat with more force and faster to pump extra oxygen to the cells thus increasing the heart rate. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit.
