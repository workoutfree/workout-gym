<p>The difference between 30 minutes of cardio and 40 minutes isn't very much, actually. The answer is that it depends. If you feel you need to speed the process a bit, there's other cardio options than running. You could do one 15 minute kettlebell hiit workout per day and get considerably more calorie burning benefit than 15 min of running, and likely better body composition as well.
