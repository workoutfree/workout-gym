<p>The number that you arrive at is considered your peak heart rate while exercising. Experts also acknowledge that vigorous exercise is the best way to lower your resting heart rate and increase your maximum aerobic capacity and heart rate (6). In general, resting heart rate (measured in beats per minute, or bpm) usually will measure somewhere between the 60’s to 100 bpm. A more specific method to find out what your aerobic threshold is an exercise test where the intensity level increases step by step and the changes in the lactate concentration of your blood is monitored with blood.

More intense exercise requires a breakdown of glycogen stores for immediate energy, which is only possible with a higher heart rate. Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is extremely beneficial for maintaining the healthy functioning of your entire body.
