High Energy 3 60 Minute HIIT, Gym Workout Mix (January 2020) by PAUL From soundcloud.com
Shorter hiit workouts have been considered a possible format to help individuals meet. In myzone terms, that would be the upper portion of green, and all of yellow and red heart rate zones. This is the maximum number of times that your heart should beat per minute during exercise. The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure.

<p>These two numbers are your average target heart rate zone for vigorous exercise intensity when using the hrr to calculate your heart rate. To get a rough idea of your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. The hiit rest periods allow participants temporary relief from the high breathing demands required with higher intensity exercise, which then promotes better engagement in the bouts of high intensity movements that are needed to improve lung functioning. If you only work at less than 80% of your training max, then you are not training in the high intensity “zone.”.</p>
