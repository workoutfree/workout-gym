Training in the blue zone helps lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body fat. Calculate your maximum heart rate. Training Zones The Alive &amp; Awake podcast Listen Notes.</p>

<p>The aerobic zone is the place where enhancements to the functional capacity of the heart, lungs, vascular and skeletal systems really occur. These zones range from very light to maximum (or peak) effort based on the percentage of your maximum heart rate that you’re training in. It is a ‘physically active transport’ policy and not a nationwide exercise training regimen that is required. A primary purpose of training is to delay the onset of fatigue during competition; Know Your Aerobic Training Zones.</p>
