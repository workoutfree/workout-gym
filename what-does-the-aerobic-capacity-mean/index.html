<p>You probably know it as “cardio.”. Aerobic fitness is a measure of the body's capacity to transport and utilize oxygen. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received.
