Hiit workout, Hiit, Hiit benefits From pinterest.com
Discussion in &#39;strength &amp; conditioning discussion&#39; started by kn0ck3d 0ut, dec 21, 2010. Do those count as hiit? I have a specific running playlist that i listen to every time i run, and it consists of 12 songs that last about 41 minutes total. That doesn’t mean that flag football isn’t intense, not cardio, and not good for you to do for those things, but it’s not the same as hiit.
