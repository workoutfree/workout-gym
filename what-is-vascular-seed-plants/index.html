Ferns (Seedless Vascular Plants) YouTube From youtube.com
All seed vascular plants have developed root systems that anchor them to the soil and extract the nutrients. The seedless vascular plants include the two phyla: It anchors the plant in the ground and transport minerals and water into the plant. More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of earth’s vegetation.

<p>Types of vascular plants angiosperms. The seedless vascular plants include the two phyla: Xylem helps in the transport of water from soil to different parts of the plant and phloem helps in the transfer of food prepared in leaves by the process of photosynthesis into different parts of the plant. Vascular plants have conducting, also referred to as vascular or liquefied, tissues that transport water, minerals, and photosynthetic materials throughout the plant’s roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
