Aerobic respiration is the release of energy from glucose or another organic substrate in the presence of oxygen. In total, just 4 atp are produced by the end of anaerobic respiration. Theoretically, there can be a net gain of 38 atp molecules by the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule in aerobic respiration. It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen:
