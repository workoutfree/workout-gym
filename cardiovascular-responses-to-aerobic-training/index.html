Exerciseinduced cardiac growth. Aerobic and resistance exercise From researchgate.net
Heart rate response to aerobic training. Most of the cardiovascular changes that occur during exercise are brought about by changes in autonomic nerve activity, triggered by the cardiovascular centre. Resting heart rate trained athletes have a lower resting heart rate due to increased efficiency of the cardiovascular system and higher stroke volume this is most evident in the recovery phases the trained athlete can recover faster (hr ’s faster) due to a more efficient. Most of the cardiovascular changes that occur during exercise are brought about by changes in autonomic nerve activity, triggered by the cardiovascular centre.

These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance. Several parallels therefore emerge between adaptation to the hypoxia of high altitude and adaptation to the struggle for oxygen created by exercise training at low altitude. 2, reﬂecting the dominant role of cardiac output as a determinant of maximal oxygen consumption.
