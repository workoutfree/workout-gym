Aerobic and anaerobic exercises vary Ka Leo From kaleo.sacredhearts.org
Anaerobic exercise has multiple benefits for the cardiovascular system, muscles, and joints. During aerobic exercises, which are less intense but last longer, our lungs and heart work hard to supply oxygen to the body. With the help of aerobic exercise, the lactic threshold rises and it also fights depression. In an adequate oxygen condition, the cells consume the sugar needed and the oxygen can fully oxidise the sugar.
