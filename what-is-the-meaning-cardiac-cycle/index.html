<p>The cardiac cycle has two facets: The cardiac cycle events are the sequence of events that occur during a heartbeat. The cardiac cycle is essentially split into two phases, systole (the contraction phase) and diastole (the relaxation phase). Cardiac cycle definition, one complete heartbeat, consisting of one contraction and relaxation of the heart. Control of cardiac cycle.</p>

<p>The cardiac cycle events are the sequence of events that occur during a heartbeat. One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive. Cardiac cycle a complete cardiac movement, or heart beat, including systole, diastole, and the intervening pause. Mechanical function of the heart can be described by the pressure, volume, and flow changes which occur within it during a single cardiac cycle, the cardiac cycle is defined as one complete sequence of contraction and relaxation, cardiac cycle time is the time required for one complete cardiac cycle.normal value: deflection point generated by ventricular repolarization wave.</p>
