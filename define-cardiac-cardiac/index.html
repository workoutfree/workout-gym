<p>Cardiac output is the amount of blood which pumped by the heart in one minute. Cardiac output is defined as the amount of blood pumped out by the ventricles in a minute. The cardiac cycle is the series of contractions in the heart that pressurize different chambers, causing blood to flood in one direction. The first, which we call ambiguus cardiovascular (acv) neurons (approximately 35 neurons per amb), define the classical cardiac parasympathetic circuit.
