Exercise has numerous health benefits. Keeping your workouts short and intense is a great way of firing up your metabolism and losing excess at the same time as toning your muscles. Skipping rope can burn 200 to 300 calories in just 15 minutes. Your second upper body or lower body workouts can also mix up the movements and rep ranges, if you follow the same upper/lower push/pull template.
