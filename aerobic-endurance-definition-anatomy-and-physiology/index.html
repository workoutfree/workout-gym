It decreases the risk of health conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes. A number of physiological factors affect success in endurance sports including the efficiency of energy systems, aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, muscle strength, power and muscular endurance. It increases your stamina and improves cardiovascular conditioning. The simplest of all aerobic exercises does not involve walking at a slow pace, but walking steadily and at a brisk pace for at least half an hour.
