The ‘best cardio for weight loss’ depends on your goals and fitness level. While you are more likely to burn lots more calories during a cardio session, there’s a good chance your metabolism will stay elevated for longer after a workout with weights. Whether you are running in place, jogging, sprinting, or running marathons, running has a massive impact on burning calories and dropping those unwanted pounds. Aim to do the least amount of cardio while still seeing appropriate rates of fat loss.
