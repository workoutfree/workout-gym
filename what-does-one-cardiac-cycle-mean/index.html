<p>Definition of cardiac cycle in the definitions.net dictionary. The cardiac cycle is the sequence of electrical and mechanical events that are repeated with each heartbeat. The cardiac cycle refers to the pattern of contraction and relaxation of the heart during one complete heartbeat. The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle.</p>
