Because anaerobic exercise increases metabolic demand. Anaerobic exercise relies mostly on stored glycogen for energy production, and it builds muscular strength. So i guess high rep bodyweight squats isn’t so much cardio as many claim to be. Also, after anaerobic training such as sprinting your heart rate stays elevated for several hours.

<p>If you are 40 years old, for instance, this formula will tell you that your target range for healthy exercise is about 108 to 144. Vigorous aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling, has the most effect on lowering your resting heart rate. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic physical training (apt) on heart rate variability (hrv) and cardiorespiratory responses at peak condition and ventilatory anaerobic threshold.

In addition, it increases your overall aerobic fitness, as measured by a treadmill test, for example, and it helps. The average resting heart rate is usually between 60 and 80 bpm.

<p>Aerobic exercise uses oxygen, and in addition to exercising the heart and lungs it burns fat, wards off disease and improves mood. The anaerobic zone is 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate. Specifically the left ventricle and it might also stiffen the aorta (the artery that immediately attaches to the heart) as well. To find the target heart rate range for your age, subtract your age from 220 and then multiply that number by 0.60 and by 0.80 to find the low and high ends of the range.
