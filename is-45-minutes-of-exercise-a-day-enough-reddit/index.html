<p>It’s important that you don’t lose sight of that because while striving to exercise for 60 minutes a day is admirable, it can also seem far too daunting to be practical. I've almost never done a 2 hour workout. In fact, even 15 minutes of exercise is not wasted effort. Within three or four months, you'll see improved muscle definition and tone. .</p>

<p>I tend to double up on my push and leg days when this happens, and my workout tends to last an hour and a half. That needs to be clear.

<p>It might be better to do 3 30 minute workouts. Thirty minutes a day or any amount of vigorous daily exercise is useful.

<p>Are you going to see as big a change as someone who is doing 30 minutes, probably not. After a month or two of working out 30 minutes a day, you may have increased confidence, a boost in mood, better sleep, and enhanced muscle tone and cardiovascular health.

Best part is that even if not hiit, the shorter workout will mean that you can up your overall intensity for the entirety of the session. .</p>
