It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen: Aerobic respiration is a biological process that involves the breakdown of food glucose. Aerobic respiration is a mode of respiration process in which an oxygen molecule is required to release energy from food. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals.

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. The respiration which uses oxygen is called aerobic respiration. Less energy (atp) is produced. An example of anaerobic respiration fermentation is partial oxidation of glycolysis molecules and pyruvate due to the citric acid cycle.</p>

<p>An example of anaerobic respiration fermentation is partial oxidation of glycolysis molecules and pyruvate due to the citric acid cycle. Aerobic respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that take place in the presence of oxygen, occurring in a cell to convert chemical energy into atps. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place. More energy (atp) is produced. Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences.</p>
