The myocardium is surrounded by a thin outer layer called the epicardium (aka visceral pericardium) and an inner endocardium. They regulate the contraction and relaxation of the heart, which helps in pumping blood through the circulatory system. Cardiac muscle is the same as the skeletal muscle, the other major muscle type. Temperature also affects the force of contraction.

Cardiac muscle (or myocardium) makes up the thick middle layer of the heart. This feature, however, also distinguishes it from smooth muscle, the third muscle type. Cardiac muscle fibers have a single nucleus, are branched, and joined to one another by intercalated discs that contain gap junctions for depolarization between cells and desmosomes to hold the fibers together when the heart contracts.

<p>Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in that it is striated and that the sarcomere is the contractile unit, with contraction being achieved by the relationship between calcium, troponins and the myofilaments. The cells that made up the cardiac muscle are collectively referred to as cardiomyocytes. The contractility can be altered by.

Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in that it is striated and that the sarcomere is the contractile unit, with contraction being achieved by the relationship between calcium, troponins and the myofilaments. This article will consider the structure of cardiac muscle as well as relevant clinical conditions. Cardiac muscle owes its striated appearance to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments that make up the contractile apparatus.</p>
