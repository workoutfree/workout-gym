<p>âhiit can burn more calories in a shorter period due to the high intensity of the workout, but traditional cardio is just as effective if the person is putting in the time, energy, and effort into every workout. The average duration for the hiit group was 36 minutes, while it was 68 minutes for the moderate cardio group. So while you would be chugging along at the same intensity from a steady state cardio workout. To try and sum it up, hiit cardio can help burn more fat and calories than steady cardio.hiit will burn fat longer after your workout and you donât have to spend as much time doing hiit.</p>
