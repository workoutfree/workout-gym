Today, while greek and latin aren&#39;t on every student&#39;s curriculum, the greek alphabet is learned as needed. It is interesting to note that some physics symbols are very relatable (like “d” for distance) while some are unrelatable (like “c” for the speed of light). Seven wonders of the world. Greek letters are used in mathematics, science, engineering, and other areas where mathematical notation is used as symbols for constants, special functions, and also conventionally for variables representing certain quantities.
