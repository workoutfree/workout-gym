<p>On a 1 to10 scale for perceived exertion, high intensity anaerobic exercise is anything over a seven.it’s not typically recommended for fitness. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic high intensity interval training (hiit) is a highly desirable workout, because it engaging all muscle fibers, the fast twitch as well as the slow twitch. And even during the time when most of the energy is supplied by the anaerobic systems, the aerobic system is used also, supplying a small percentage of the energy.
