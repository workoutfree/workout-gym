Endurance Training Influences Gene Expression In Muscles IFLScience From iflscience.com
Muscular endurance is the ability to continue contracting a muscle, or group of muscles, against resistance, such as weights or body weight, over a period of time. It turns out that endurance exercise not only makes you happier, but it also helps you sleep better. In general, this type of exercise training refers to any type of activity that trains the aerobic energy system as opposed to the anaerobic energy system. Your aerobic energy system is what allows you to sustain exercise for longer than 2 minutes.
