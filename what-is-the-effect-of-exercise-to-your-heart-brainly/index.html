<p>Just as exercise strengthens other muscles in your body, it helps your heart muscle become more efficient and better able to pump blood throughout your body. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). As blood flow increases, your brain is exposed to more oxygen and nutrients. Meanwhile, your lungs are also taking in more air, hence the harder breathing.

<p>Exercise boosts physical capabilities and can even change physical appearance, but it also improves the condition of the brain and cognition. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that arenât working much (like your digestive tract or arms). As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. Exercise also induces the release of beneficial proteins in the brain.

<p>As your heart rate increases during exercise, blood flow to the brain increases. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Meanwhile, your lungs are also taking in more air, hence the harder breathing. This need means that your heart starts pumping faster, which makes for a quicker pulse. The graph shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme.</p>

<p>Exercise also stimulates the production of new blood vessels. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that arenât working much (like your digestive tract or arms). Ideal exercise for the heart. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).
