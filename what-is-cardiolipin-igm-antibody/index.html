<p>Traditionally, anticardiolipin antibodies were used as a screening test; An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. The anticardiolipin antibodies are often responsible for the abnormal formation of clots in veins and arteries which are known as phlebitis and arterial thromboses respectively. Platelets, blood cells that help blood clot, also become depleted leading to. Cardiolipin ELISA kit Autoimmune Disease kits FDACE 8185913030 USA..</p>

<p>Anticardiolipins are antibodies produced by the immune system against the platelet membrane phospholipids responsible for the coagulation of blood clots. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood. The three types of anticardiolipin antibodies are the igg, iga and igm types and this particular test measures the level of igg type antibodies in the blood.

<p>Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. When an igg, igm, and/or iga cardiolipin antibody is detected, the test may be repeated several weeks later to determine whether the antibody is temporary or persistent. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated. Cardiolipin antibodies (ca) are seen in a subgroup of patients with autoimmune disorders, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), who are at risk for vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral infarct and/or recurrent.
