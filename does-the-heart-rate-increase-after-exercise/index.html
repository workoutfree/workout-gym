Cardiac output is the rate of blood pumped by the heart. After doing barely any exercise for 3 months due to illness, i played football last night, and my resting heart rate (normally 55bpm) has increased to 89bpm. Blood contains the nutrients (glucose) and oxygen, required for the muscles. Why does your breathing rate increase after a race?

When you are exercising, the heartâs blood flow increases by around four or five times from when you are at rest. As the amount of blood increased, the heart rate also increased to meet the demand for nutrients and oxygen. When you exercise your muscles use more energy. Why does your heart rate increase as you exercise? Biology, Room 267.</p>
