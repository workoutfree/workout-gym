Cardiac output is the rate of blood pumped by the heart. After doing barely any exercise for 3 months due to illness, i played football last night, and my resting heart rate (normally 55bpm) has increased to 89bpm. Blood contains the nutrients (glucose) and oxygen, required for the muscles. Why does your breathing rate increase after a race?

Why does your heart rate increase as you exercise? Biology, Room 267.</p>
