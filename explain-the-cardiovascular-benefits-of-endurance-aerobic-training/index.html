Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance.

Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope.
