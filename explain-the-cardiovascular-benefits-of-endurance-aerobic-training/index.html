Cardiovascular exercise may help you manage symptoms of high blood pressure. Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance. Regular sessions of 30 to 60 minutes of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (at around 55 to 70 per cent of maximum heart rate) can be an important part of a weight loss or weight management programme that is also mindful of the energy (calories) consumed as food. Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope.
