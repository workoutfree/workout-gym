The world health organization recommends a week of aerobic and anaerobic activity. Results can be given as either peak work capacity (wpeak) or oxygen consumption at peak exercise (vo2peak). In what is often categorised as anaerobic exercise, anaerobic processes dominate in releasing energy that the body can use to perform. Anaerobic exercise can also boost your mood and help ease the effects of anxiety and depression.
