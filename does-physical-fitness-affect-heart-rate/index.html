Exercise Target Heart Rate What You Should Know Penn Medicine From pennmedicine.org
Women p = 0.002), and positively associated with muscular strength in women (p = 0.002) but not in men. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. Heart rate can be defined as the average number of heart beats per minute and can be monitored using a stethoscope. However, this can be conditioned to the individual and their.
