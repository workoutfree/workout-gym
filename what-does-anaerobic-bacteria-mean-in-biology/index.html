Pertaining to or caused by the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. For example, some anaerobic bacteria that live deep in mud in swampy areas use a sulfate ion instead of oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide is produced as a byproduct, rather. An anaerobic culture means the test is done without letting oxygen get to the sample.

<p>It does not have the ability to detoxify oxygen. An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is considered, in this context, to be any microorganism that does not require oxygen for growth. â¢ obligate anaerobes (microorganisms that live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen) will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. In humans, these bacteria generally live in the gastrointestinal tract, but they may also be found in other places outside the body, including in the soil and water, in foods, and in animals.
