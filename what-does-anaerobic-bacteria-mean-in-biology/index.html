Pertaining to or caused by the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. For example, some anaerobic bacteria that live deep in mud in swampy areas use a sulfate ion instead of oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide is produced as a byproduct, rather. An anaerobic culture means the test is done without letting oxygen get to the sample.
