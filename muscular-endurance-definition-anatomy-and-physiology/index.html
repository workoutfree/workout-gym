Body Movement Anatomy From boundbobskryptis.blogspot.com
A number of physiological factors affect success in endurance sports including the efficiency of energy systems, aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, muscle strength, power and muscular endurance. After reading this chapter, the athletic training student should be able to: Local muscle endurance is best described as the ability to resist muscular fatigue and describes how a given type of contraction can be sustained, typically measured in terms of the number of repetitions. These include, genetics, sex, age, aerobic (vo₂max) and anaerobic capacity, movement economy as well as training background.

<h3 id="conversely-a-lack-of-use-can-result-in-decreased-performance-and-muscle-appearance">Conversely, A Lack Of Use Can Result In Decreased Performance And Muscle Appearance.</h3><p>When you’re performing aerobic exercises, you’re practicing muscular endurance. Muscular strength is defined as the ability of your nervous and muscular systems to produce enough force in your connective tissues and muscles to move an external force, such as weight or your body against gravity. You can see here that the fitness components of power, speed, agility and maximal strength (i.e. Endurance is the ability to sustain an activity for extended periods of time and usually refers to aerobic ability.</p>

Still, muscular endurance and cardiovascular endurance are linked. Strength and power are often confused, but the main difference is speed, according to exrx.net.

<h3 id="it-is-one-of-the-most-important-qualities-in-the-athletic-arena">It Is One Of The Most Important Qualities In The Athletic Arena.</h3><p>Unlike power, strength requires no. They are fundamentally done at close to 100% effort (meaning a rapid rate of atp production is required). Muscular endurance is the ability to exert you for long periods of time and to recover quickly from an activity or trauma. An endurance sport is any sport where there is a requirement to sustain an activity level whilst enduring a level of physical stress.</p>
