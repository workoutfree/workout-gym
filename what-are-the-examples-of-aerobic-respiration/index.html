<p>After that the yeast converts the pyruvate into ethanol and releases energy. It starts in the cell's cytoplasm and moves into the mitochondria, where additional processes take place.

<p>Aerobic respiration respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration. Free oxygen means that there should be an excessive and constant supply of oxygen in the environment to perform aerobic respiration. It starts in the cell's cytoplasm and moves into the mitochondria, where additional processes take place. In living beings, cellular respiration is an aerobic mechanism in which full oxidation of glucose generates the energy necessary by the organism.
