Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. Igg is the anticardiolipin antibody type most associated with complications. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting.

Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).
