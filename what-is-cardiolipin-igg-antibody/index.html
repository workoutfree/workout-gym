Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. Igg is the anticardiolipin antibody type most associated with complications. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting.

<p>Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria for aps. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages.
