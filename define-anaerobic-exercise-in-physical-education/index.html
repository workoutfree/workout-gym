<p>A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training. Anaerobic literally means âwithout air,â so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Hence, aerobic exercise can be defined as the one, which involves the use of oxygen to produce energy, whereas anaerobic exercise makes the body to produce energy without using oxygen. Short intervals of exercise at maximum intensity followed by short periods of. Introduction to the energy systems.</p>
