Paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension updates on definition From erj.ersjournals.com
Pubmed, web of science, and scopus databases were searched from inception until 30 april, 2018. The authors concluded that resistance training by itself is effective in reducing blood pressure among hypertensive individuals. Randomized, controlled trials lasting ≥4 weeks investigating the effects of resistance. This blood pressure is normal and safe.
