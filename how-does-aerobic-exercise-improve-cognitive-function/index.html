New Study Shows Aerobic Exercise Can Improve Cognitive Function — Steemit From steemit.com
Aerobic exercise enhances executive function in overweight children. Some benefits of aerobics include improved cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, regulating blood sugar, and even can reduce chronic pain. The study, that appeared in the journal of applied physiology, found evidence that one year of aerobic exercise training improved cardiorespiratory fitness, cerebral blood flow regulation, and memory function in people with mild cognitive impairment. This exercise seems to prime the nervous system to learn new.
