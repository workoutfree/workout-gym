<p>If the mve is &gt; 85% of predicted (i.e., the ventilatory reserve is &lt; 15%), then the patient is abnormally limited by pulmonary disease. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the most comprehensive technique which allows a holistic approach to cardiopulmonary diseases. During the cpet test the patient will be required to perform mild exercise on an upright bicycle whilst breathing through a mouthpiece. The results of a cardiopulmonary exercise test will show the amount of oxygen your body is using, the amount of carbon dioxide your body produces, your breathing pattern, and your heart rate and rhythm through the administration of an ekg during the procedure.
