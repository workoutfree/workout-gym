Exercise can help release tension and stress by releasing endorphins in your body that can essentially send you into a euphoric state. Research in animals since the late 1980s has found that exercise increases brain concentrations of norepinephrine in brain regions involved in the body&#39;s stress response. For best results, time your workouts at least two to three hours before bedtime to give your body time to wind down and prepare for bed.
