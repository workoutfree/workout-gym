<p>A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. Suppose your age is 35 years, your maximum heart rate is 185 beats per minute. There's a pretty straightforward math equation to figuring out how high your heart rate should get when you're doing hiit. The figures are averages, so use them as a general guide.

<p>An example is doing sprint intervals during a jog. Generally your heart rate would increase to 80% to 85% or more during the intense phase and drop down to 60% to 70% during the recovery phase although this can vary. By using a monitor, time is no longer needed as a measuring tool. For example, iâm 37 years old, so my hiit heart rate target zone would be calculated as follows: High intensity interval training heart rate zones Sport, perte de.</p>

<p>In our opinion the best watches for use while hiit training is the polar m430 or the garmin forerunner 235. You want to push yourself during the work period of the interval so that you. When using max heart rate (mhr) as a guide, high intensity can be considered exercising above 80% of mhr.

<p>These heart rate spikes are the marker of a hiit workout. The heart rate monitor removes the guesswork and allows you to accurately measure your recovery time when performing hiit. Your heart rate will stay quite high for a while after your high intensity interval, this is perfectly normal.

<p>First and foremost, you need to calculate your maximum heart rate (mhr). Hereâs a simple formula to calculate your hiit heart rate target zones (in beats per minute bpm): That's the easiest way to measure your heart rate for hiit and it's an incredibly effective gauge because it is based on your current fitness levelânot some arbitrary number. The heart rate will fluctuate around this value, but itâs a smart. HIIT vs LISS A Clear Explanation Of Which Is Better for Fat Loss &amp; Fitness.</p>

There's a pretty straightforward math equation to figuring out how high your heart rate should get when you're doing hiit. It incorporates several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of oneâs maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements.
