Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; It can be good to think of aerobic and anaerobic exercises on a scale. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. Everyone, at some point in their life, would have performed anaerobic exercise.
