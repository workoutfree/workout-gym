Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; It can be good to think of aerobic and anaerobic exercises on a scale. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. Everyone, at some point in their life, would have performed anaerobic exercise.

Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training.
