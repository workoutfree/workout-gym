Why Am I Gaining Weight Doing HIIT Here Is How Too Much Exercise From betterme.world
What’s wrong?… the post why am i gaining weight even when i exercise?. All that hiit will do is make you lose strength in the weight room and make your workouts mediocre at best. Excess belly fat (even in lean people) elevated cortisol levels drive hunger and cravings for tasty junk foods, which is why chronically elevated levels can lead to weight gain or prevent weight. While muscle and fat weigh the same, the former is more dense, meaning it occupies a much smaller space in the body.
