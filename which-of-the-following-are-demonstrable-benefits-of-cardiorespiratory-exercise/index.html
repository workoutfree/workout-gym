The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). Longer durations of large muscle exercises are possible. The demand for oxygen is increased during the exercise and this is transported to the muscle by an increase in respiration rate during exercise. The efficiency of the respiratory system increases
