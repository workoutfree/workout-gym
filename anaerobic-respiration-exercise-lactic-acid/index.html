<p>State the word equation for anaerobic respiration in muscles during hard exercise (glucose â lactic acid). After vigorous exercise, you may find you are still breathing.exercise cannot be sustained when anaerobic respiration takes place in muscle cells because of the lactic acid that builds up as a result of bypassing the use of oxygen. The other type of &gt;anaerobic&lt;/b&gt; respiration is lactic acid fermentation. The difference is made up by anaerobic metabolism, of which the principal product is lactic acid (see fig.

<p>This is disproven by the fact that our muscles, during vigorous exercises, undergo anaerobic respiration, where lactic acid is produced as the waste byproduct instead of carbon dioxide. A build up of h+ will make the muscle cells acidic and. Anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level occurs when oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation are compromised. The physiological changes in respiratory gas exchange resulting from the inadequate 02 supply for the energy transformations are, as we have measured them, described in fig.
