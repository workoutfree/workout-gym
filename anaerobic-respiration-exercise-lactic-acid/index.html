Anaerobic respiration is the process of creating energy without the presence of oxygen. State the word equation for anaerobic respiration in muscles during hard exercise (glucose → lactic acid).

<p>This is disproven by the fact that our muscles, during vigorous exercises, undergo anaerobic respiration, where lactic acid is produced as the waste byproduct instead of carbon dioxide. A build up of h+ will make the muscle cells acidic and. Anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level occurs when oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation are compromised.
