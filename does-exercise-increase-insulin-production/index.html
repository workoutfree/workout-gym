Difference Between Insulin and Glucagon Difference Wiki From difference.wiki
This begs the question of how to increase insulin production naturally and preferably with food or exercise. There are actually not many foods that directly increase insulin production. Your working muscles use more glucose to help meet their increased energy needs. 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of juice or regular soda (not diet), or.

Specifically in people with type 2 diabetes, exercise can improve insulin sensitivity as well as help lower elevated blood glucose levels to keep them in the normal range. In very high intensity exercise (about 80% of vo(2 max)) or when high intensity exercise follows a low intensity one, there is a tendency of the bg to increase due to excessive circulating catecholamines necessitating postexercise short acting insulin.</p>

<p>Insulin resistance represents a window of time when progression towards more severe metabolic disease can be prevented by lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise. Exercise training alone, however, does not improve glycemic control, although it improves physical fitness and insulin sensitivity. However, one problem with this apparently simple approach to treating insulin resistance is that most people find it difficult to maintain exercise regimens for long periods of time. In very high intensity exercise (about 80% of vo(2 max)) or when high intensity exercise follows a low intensity one, there is a tendency of the bg to increase due to excessive circulating catecholamines necessitating postexercise short acting insulin. 7.
