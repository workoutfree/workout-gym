It is a lateral meristem, which evolves either as longitudinal strands or as a hollow cylinder. The vascular cambium of trees is a secondary meristem and is responsible for the formation of the xylem and phloem. In secondary origin, the cambium is called interfascicular cambium. The peripheral derivative of vascular cambium is phellem while that of cork cambium is the secondary phloem.

<p>Xylem is a vascular tissue which transports water and minerals through. It is to note that vascular cambium is absent from most monocotyledons, pteridophytes and some herbaceous dicotyledons. Vascular cambium is a thin layer of cells found in plants, separating two other types of plant vascular tissue, xylem and phloem.

<p>Xylem is a vascular tissue which transports water and minerals through. The cambial zone includes a tier of meristematic cells between the developing wood (xylem) towards the inside of the stem and bark (phloem) tissue towards the outside (figure 7.19). Woody plants also have secondary indeterminate mitotic regions towards the exterior of roots, stems and branches that produce the cells for continued growth in girth.

<p>In annuals the vascular cambium remains active only during the growth of the plant and ceases its activity before the plant dies. The vascular cambium and cork cambium are secondary meristems that are formed in stems and roots after the tissues of the primary plant body have differentiated. Cambium is a layer of material inside a plant or tree which consists of actively dividing cells which generate growth for the plant.

<p>It is to note that vascular cambium is absent from most monocotyledons, pteridophytes and some herbaceous dicotyledons. Secondary phloem forms along the outer edge of the cambium ring, and secondary xylem (i.e., wood) forms along the inner edge of the cambium. The cambium is filled with undifferentiated cells which have the ability to differentiate into many different types. Cork cambium and vascular cambium are two types of cambium in plants that are involved in the secondary growth. Meristematic Tissue How A Plant Grows Larger Plants Grow Here.</p>
