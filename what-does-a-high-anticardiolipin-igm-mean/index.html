A positive result supports the diagnosis only in the presence of thrombosis or fetal loss. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. Since igm are antibodies formed in response to a first time infection, high levels could mean a new infection.
