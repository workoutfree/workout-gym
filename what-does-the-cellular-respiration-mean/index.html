Cellular Respiration Photosynthesis ABC Worksheet From abcworksheet.com
Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body. Information and translations of cellular respiration in the most comprehensive dictionary definitions resource on the web. During glycolysis, glucose and oxygen are the substrates that result in two atp being made as products; Although much of the energy from cellular respiration is released as heat, some of it is used to make atp.
