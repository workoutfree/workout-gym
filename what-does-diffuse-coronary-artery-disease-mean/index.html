<meta name="description" content="The 23 Step What Does Diffuse Coronary Artery Disease Mean For Diet, Hydroxyapatite was not detected in normal coronary artery sections. Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition.
August 2008 Dr.S.Venkatesan MD From drsvenkatesan.wordpress.com
To understand the mechanisms responsible for the formation of atherosclerotic calcification, we examined human coronary arteries for the presence and extent of mineral. Hydroxyapatite was not detected in normal coronary artery sections. The posterior descending artery was considered part of either the rca or lcx system, depending upon the coronary artery dominance. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium.
