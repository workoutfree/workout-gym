Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration because it produces more atp per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration.
Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences From biodifferences.net
Aerobic and anaerobic respiration are common types of ‘cellular respiration’. Anaerobic respiration also produces energy and uses glucose, but it produces less energy and does not. When the breakdown of glucose food occurs with the use of oxygen ,it is called aerobic respiration. As we know, a cell in any living body helps carry out all the essential functions to stay alive.

<p>Aerobic respiration is the main type of aerobic process that breaks down the bonds in the glucose molecule to form atp using the released energy. Inhaling oxygen by the cellular system (while respiration is aerobic) produces carbon dioxide as a product.

<p>The cellular respiration, both aerobic and anaerobic, is a process of transferring the energy from glucose to atp. On entering one glucose molecule, 32 atp molecules are produced during aerobic respiration. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy.

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a procedure of cellular respiration that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. Inhaling oxygen by the cellular system (while respiration is aerobic) produces carbon dioxide as a product. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences.</p>

<p>Aerobic respiration is a slow and steady process that takes place over a long period of time. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is that aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen whereas aerobic respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen. This is due to the fact that aerobic respiration uses oxygen to complete the process of cellular respiration, while anaerobic respiration does not. The differences between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration include where the processes occur, what chemicals are involved in the processes, and what substances are produced by the two processes.

<p>The cellular respiration, both aerobic and anaerobic, is a process of transferring the energy from glucose to atp. Aerobic cellular respiration is a type of cellular respiration that uses oxygen. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. This is due to the fact that aerobic respiration uses oxygen to complete the process of cellular respiration, while anaerobic respiration does not.
