Endurance Spread Meaning From spreadmeaning.com
Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle, or a group of muscles, to exert a force for a prolonged period. An athlete with good muscular endurance can repeat a series of muscular contractions without fatiguing. Endurance exercise training is arguably the most potent stimulus for increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and enhancing oxidative phosphorylation capacity.
