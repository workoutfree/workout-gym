The main difference between aerobic and muscular endurance is that aerobic endurance is the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, while muscular endurance is the ability of the muscles to resist fatigue and continue to function over time. Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope. These two terms are often used interchangeably, and while they both relate to how long and how hard you can perform physical activity, they are slightly different. Training for aerobic endurance is more commonly referred to as cardio because it uses the cardiorespiratory system (heart, lungs, veins, arteries, portal vessels and coronary vessels).
