Building cardiovascular fitness From slideshare.net
Cardiopulmonary exercise tests can be divided into two general categories, depending on the protocols used to perform the test: A cardiopulmonary exercise test, or cpet for short, is a type of stress test that examines how well the lungs, heart, and muscles work individually and together. Cpet is a useful adjunctive tool for the assessment of patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Simple objective tests of functional capacity using a structured questionnaire (the duke activity.

Many physicians are unfamiliar with it, in part because historically it was cumbersome, done mostly in research or exercise physiology centers, and used mostly in assessing athletic fitness rather than pathologic conditions.
