<p>While this is obviously not quite accurate since you can’t do any activities without breathing, it illustrates how anaerobic exercise is different from aerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. The more lean muscle you have, the more calories you’ll burn during your next sweat session. Anaerobic exercise is a diverse category of exercise that is typically intended to.

<p>Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. Like resistance training, the anaerobic activity will strengthen and add density to your bones. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time.
