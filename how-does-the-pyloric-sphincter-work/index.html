The pyloric sphincter is controlled by a ring of nerves called the vagus nerve. How does reflux happen when you have weakened sphincters? Sphincters are circular muscles that serve as valves to open and close certain parts of the body. The pyloric sphincter is meant to control the speed at which the stomach contents are passed into the small intestines.

<p>The constriction of sphincter prevents the foods. One of the functions of the sphincter is to regulate the amount of chyme that is released into the duodenum, allowing maximum absorption of nutrients. A common problem for this pyloric valve is for it to be too tight. The pylorus is a muscle that opens and closes to allow food to pass through the stomach into the intestine.</p>

<p>How does the pyloric sphincter work? For example, the digestive system has several sphincters that regulate the passage of fluid and food from the mouth to the stomach, through the intestines, and out the anus. The mucosal and muscle layers of the stomach and duodenum are discontinuous due to the presence of a ring of connective tissue on the duodenal side of the pyloric sphincter, but the myenteric plexi of the pylorus and duodenal bulb are continuous. Another important function of the pyloric sphincter is to inhibit the reabsorption of chyme and bile. Pyloromyotomy (Pediatric) YouTube.</p>

<p>It plays an important role in digestion, where it acts as a valve to controls the flow of partially digested food from the stomach to the small intestine. Unlike the lower esophageal sphincter (les), which opens and closes without our conscious effort, the upper esophageal sphincter is under our conscious control. The pyloric sphincter is controlled by a ring of nerves called the vagus nerve.
