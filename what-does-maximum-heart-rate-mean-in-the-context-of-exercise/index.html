Your heart rate can increase from a variety of things, such as tiredness, too much caffeine, or a lack of hydration. There are a number of formulas out there for calculating max heart rate. So if you’re 40 years old, your max heart rate would be 180 bpm. Make music your ultimate training partner.

The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max.
