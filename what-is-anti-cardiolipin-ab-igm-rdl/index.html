When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. The two most commonly tested are igg and igm. (2) thrombocytopenia or a reduced platelet count; A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested.
