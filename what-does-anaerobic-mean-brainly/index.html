<p>Examples aerobic respiration occurs in many plants and animals (eukaryotes). Respiration is a chemical reaction which takes place in all livings cells and releases energy from glucose. Anaerobic respiration means “without air”. Sometimes there is not enough oxygen around for some organisms to respire, but they still need the energy to survive. Which of these is a characteristic of a radioactive nucleus?.</p>
