A Q&amp;A with Lubaina Himid Fisun Güner From fisunguner.com
Whereas, ‘cyclist b’ has a heart rate of 170 beats per minute, but, a stroke volume of 61.77ml, thus the exact same cardiac. Cyclists looking to optimize their interval training for endurance benefits should perform intervals ranging between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, at a very hard intensity. Leg speed in cycling is just as important as your stride rate in running. Combining force work along with steady endurance training in the early season will help lead to better form on the bike and overall endurance.
