Belly Only Pregnancy Workout Diary of a Fit Mommy From diaryofafitmommy.com
People with ‘bad’ genes may have a harder time losing weight despite doing cardio for hours. As the digestion process begins to take place, this “food weight” will begin to disappear. My guess is that even though you are eating healthy foods and exercising, you are consuming more calories each day than your body needs to burn each day, so your body is turning the excess calories into stored fat and muscle. Ask just about anyone and they&#39;ll tell you that diet and exercise are the two most important components of losing weight.
