Healthy Heart Rate Variability / Heart Rate Variability Analysis From klaixelt.blogspot.com
Hrv is controlled by your autonomic nervous system (ans). Hrv is modulated by many physiologic or pathologic states. This is where an objective, individualized measure of the body’s response to lifestyle factors such as heart rate variability comes in. Experimental data in the dog suggest that exercise eliminates the incidence of ventricular fibrillation in previously susceptible animals via enhanced baroreceptor control and vagal modulation , represented by increased hrv after endurance exercise.

<p>Exercise has been proposed as a possible antiarrhythmic intervention in humans. Therefore, the variation in milliseconds between consecutive heartbeats (a.k.a., your heart rate variability) will go down as your heart rate climbs. Among other things, your ans regulates involuntary body functions, such as your heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, etc. It does this by measuring the variability between your heart beats over a given period of time.
