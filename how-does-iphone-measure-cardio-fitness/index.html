<p>The latest ios 14.3 and watchos 7.2 updates have introduced a new way to measure your health, specifically your cardio fitness level. For best results, make sure your weight is correct in your fitbit profile. Cardiorespiratory endurance is determined by the amount of oxygen taken in by the body (vo2 max) and how efficiently it is utilised during vigorous activity. In short, the better your vo2 max levels are, the fitter.</p>
