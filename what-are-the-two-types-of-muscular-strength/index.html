<p>Muscular strength is a muscle's capacity to exert brute force against resistance. Examples of exercises that develop muscular strength and power include resistance training, such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance band exercises. Some biomechanists may actually question the theoretical constructs of each of these types of contraction but from a practical perspective they are adequate to describe the type of exercise being performed. Muscles are highly specialized to contract forcefully. 13 Muscle Facts For Kids, Types, Diagram, And Parts.</p>
