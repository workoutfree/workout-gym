The key part of aerobic respiration is that it requires oxygen to occur. If the aerobic respiration rate within a biofilm is greater than the inward oxygen diffusion rate, the metal/biofilm interface can become anaerobic and provide a niche for sulphide production by srb. It is different from anaerobic respiration, which does not require.

<p>More detailed differences between the two are as follows: Thus, it is also called a citric acid. If the aerobic respiration rate within a biofilm is greater than the inward oxygen diffusion rate, the metal/biofilm interface can become anaerobic and provide a niche for sulphide production by srb. The key part of aerobic respiration is that it requires oxygen to occur. Fermentation Assignment Point.</p>

<p>The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body cells, including inhalation and exhalation , diffusion of oxygen from the pulmonary alveoli to the blood and of carbon dioxide from the blood to the alveoli, followed by the transport of oxygen to and carbon dioxide from the. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. It is different from anaerobic respiration, which does not require. Differences Between Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Science Life.</p>
