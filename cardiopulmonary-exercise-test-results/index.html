Information about the heart and lungs is collected to understand if the body’s response to exercise is normal or abnormal. This article provides basic information addressed to the clinical cardiologist regarding the utility and the indications of the cpet technique in the everyday clinical practice. Regardless of the exercise protocol used, the heart rate at peak exercise was lower in class b and c patients compared to class a patients (p&lt;0.01 for class a vs. The results of your cpet will be sent to the doctor who requested the test, most.

<p>This study aimed to explore the diagnostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) and the oxygen uptake kinetics indexes of cpet. To further evaluate his dyspnea on exertion, the patient underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) on a cycle ergometer with arterial blood gas samples obtained from an indwelling radial. As its decision points, this algorithm uses routinely obtained measurements from the results of these exercise tests, such as v˙o2, v˙co2, v˙e, sao2, hr, and at. Regardless of the exercise protocol used, the heart rate at peak exercise was lower in class b and c patients compared to class a patients (p&lt;0.01 for class a vs. example of a cardiopulmonary exercise test performed before a.</p>
