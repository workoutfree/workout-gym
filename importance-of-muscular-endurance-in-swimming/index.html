Respiratory muscle training (rmt) has been shown to improve divers swimming endurance at 4 feet of depth; One of the best exercises for your quadriceps is to do lunges with weights in your hands. Improves muscle endurance and strength constant repetition of strokes improve muscle endurance and because water is much denser than air, the higher resistance against the body&#39;s movements cause the muscles to be strengthened and toned. Thus, their training needs to include almost all the training methods, because they require a good level of endurance, whether they swim short or long distances.
