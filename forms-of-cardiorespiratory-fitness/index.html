<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) and physical inactivity have been associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases, including coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and some forms of cancer.blair et al. All forms of aerobic activity can promote cardiorespiratory fitness. This form of energy production is contingent on the ability of the cr system to deliver oxygen and nutrients and the cell’s ability to process that oxygen.
