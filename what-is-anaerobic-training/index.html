A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training. By now, you probably get the idea of how aerobic running differs from anaerobic running: Any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen is termed as anaerobic exercise. It doesn’t need oxygen to work and is the faster of the two processes.

Intermediate metabolites, such as lactic acid, cannot be eliminated by respiration, then accumulates in muscle cells, causing muscle soreness. Sprinting is a fantastic way to burn fat by exerting energy in bursts. As the opposite of aerobic, anaerobic training means ‘without air’.
