      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Min Does Hiit Training Burn More Fat For Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;, High intensity interval training, or hiit for short, has been promoted as one of the most effective training methods ever to come down the pike, both for fat loss and for cardiovascular fitness. That brings us to this question, “does hiit burn belly fat?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://workoutfree.github.io/img/placeholder.svg&#34; data-src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/blushandpearls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/why-hiit-is-the-best-fat-burning-workout-to-lose-weight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;why hiit is the best fat burning workout to lose weight Blush &amp;amp;amp; Pearls&#34; title=&#34;why hiit is the best fat burning workout to lose weight Blush &amp;amp;amp; Pearls&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https:\/\/workoutfree.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg&#39;;&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;
why hiit is the best fat burning workout to lose weight Blush &amp;amp; Pearls From blushandpearls.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, two minutes of deadlifts followed by one minute of running in place is excellent exercise, but it is not hiit. Perform up to 10 rounds of 15 sec. This is partly due to it being a cardiovascular exercise, and cardio exercises burn more calories than strength training. Each one has its own mechanism that translates to fat loss and if your schedule permits i suggest you try all of them at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
