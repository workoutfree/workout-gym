Factors affecting cardiac output, Stroke volume, Heart rate &amp; blood From online-sciences.com
Exercise affects all people differently, specifically a person’s heart rate and blood pressure. This means the heart beats fewer. The most efficient way to meet these needs involved the use of oxygen to break down glucose. With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate.

<p>The more you exercise, the more effectively your heart pumps oxygen to your muscles. Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart's arteries to dilate more readily. However, exercising at a maximum heart rate (hrmax) for each workout session does not produce significant exercise results. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat.
