Physiological adaptations in response to aerobic training From slideshare.net
Some studies have evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise training on vo 2 max in women with breast cancer. However, as shown in figure 1 , men and women did not differ in their increased aerobic capacity after. Aerobic exercise improves autonomic function in patients with chf and cvd.
