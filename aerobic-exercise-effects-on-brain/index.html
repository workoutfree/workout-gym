<p>Scientists have found that regular aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, and helps to support the formation of new neural and vascular connections. Aerobic exercise has a concentrated benefit on the hippocampus, increasing the growth of new neurons and new blood vessels, and increasing synaptic plasticity, which helps facilitate the integration of hippocampal neurons into existing brain networks. A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise (e.g., 30 minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain cognitive functions, healthy alterations in gene expression.

<p>Increased blood flow to the brain, among other factors, has a physiological impact that can improve cognitive function, according to the world health organization’s (who) 2019 guidelines on risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia. Similarly to healthy adults, aerobic exercise significantly benefited performance in sustained attention, higher accuracy rate, and shorter reaction times in children. It could be because exercise slows the damage and breakdown of brain cells. Aerobic exercise increases gray matter in brain brain imaging at baseline and 24 weeks revealed that aerobic exercise training is associated with significantly increased cortical thickness in the left caudal middle frontal cortex.
