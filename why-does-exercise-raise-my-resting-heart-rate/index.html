What Is a Normal Heart Rate? UPMC HealthBeat From share.upmc.com
The more you exercise, the easier it is to reach your target heart rate, which is up to 90% of your maximum heart rate. The usual range for resting heart rate is anywhere between 60 and 90 beats per minute. You can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. This cardiovascular drift occurs as you lose water through sweating and as your heart directs more blood to your skin in order to cool you down.
