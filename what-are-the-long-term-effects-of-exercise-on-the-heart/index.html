<p>In addition, working muscles increase stroke volume by sending higher amounts of blood volume back towards the lungs for oxygen. Intense exercise causes a steeper increase in your heart rate than moderate exercise. Lower blood pressure, increased bone density, and improved quality of life are just a few health benefits you’ll get from a regular fitness routine. The heart eventually becomes more efficient, and no longer needs to beat as quickly to supply the body with blood while at rest.</p>

<p>In the long run, physical activity may increase your lifespan and improve cardiovascular function. Cardiac hypertrophy is where your heart muscle thickens and blood volume increases. Chronic extreme exercise training and competing in endurance events can lead to heart damage and rhythm disorders. In addition, working muscles increase stroke volume by sending higher amounts of blood volume back towards the lungs for oxygen. 1.2.2. Lesson 3 long term effects part 1.</p>

<p>The most common causes of hypertrophy are related to increased blood pressure in either the lungs or the body. Your heart, which is a muscular organ, gets a workout. The improved elasticity delivers more oxygen and glucose to your muscles at a faster rate. In one study, older adults who engaged in regular exercise experienced an 8.4 percent reduction in resting heart rate. PPT The Circulatory System And Exercise PowerPoint Presentation ID.</p>
