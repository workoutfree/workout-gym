High intensity interval training (hiit) it is considered a complete workout that combines both aerobic and strength (resistance) training. VOmax defines the maxiumum aerobic work rate and is a good measure of.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the two most common training types are aerobic training and high intensity training or repeat anaerobic effort. High intensity interval training (hiit) it is considered a complete workout that combines both aerobic and strength (resistance) training. Anaerobic training effect uses heart rate and speed (or power) to determine how a workout affects your ability to perform at a very high intensity. If the intensity is too high, then the players will be unable to maintain a high enough work rate during subsequent work bouts and the desired effect of the aerobic hi training will be lost.
