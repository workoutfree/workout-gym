10 Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments Hypoglycemia Facty Health From facty.com
The effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity can last for up to 48 hours after the activity. This causes a small rise in blood sugar during intense exercise that may persist for up to one or two hours. If you&#39;re taking insulin or other medications that can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), test your blood sugar 15 to 30 minutes before exercising. Understanding how to maintain healthy blood glucose levels during exercise is particularly important for people with diabetes.
