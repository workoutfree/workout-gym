<p>The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Evaluate the potential benefits associated with different types of training. The above review suggests that exercising. The primary function of the cardiovascular system is to increase oxygen supply to the skeletal and cardiac muscle.</p>

<p>The changes in cardiac function during exercise therefore occur too rapidly to be explained by activation of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes. The result is tachycardia, an increased stroke volume, and an increase in blood pressure. Rather, it is a dynamic period in which many physiological changes occur. The cardiovascular system serves five important functions (1) during exercise: The effects of cold and exercise on the cardiovascular system Heart.</p>

First of all, it can decrease blood pressure and cholesterol, leading to a lower risk of heart disease. Not only does physical activity improve the skeletal and muscular systems of the body, it also has a number of benefits for the cardiovascular system. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen.
