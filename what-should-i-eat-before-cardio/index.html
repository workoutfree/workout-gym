Should You Eat Before a Morning Workout? Here&#39;s What Experts Think From pinterest.com
Avoid alcohol and minimize caffeinated drinks before doing cardio or strength training. On a cardio day make sure to top up your carb stores, because having carbs beforehand fuels long endurance training and it also enhances shorter intensity training. Your stored sources of carbohydrate and fat are more than adequate to fuel a workout session. This should be a light snack of simple carbohydrates, like a banana, orange, or a snack bar.
