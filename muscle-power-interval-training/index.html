Include the energy system stressed, the work and time intervals, and the number of repetitions. Specifically, each leg was randomly assigned to complete six sessions of work‐ and duration‐matched hiit (4 × (5 min at 65% of peak power and 2.5 min at 20% of peak power)) or mict (30 min at 50% of peak power) over 2 weeks. 10 reps first round, 15 reps second round, and 20 reps third round. For most athletes, training consists of a mixture of speed work and endurance work.
