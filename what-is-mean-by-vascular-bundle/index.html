Vascular bundles are classified based on different criterion a) depending upon the presence or absence of cambrium they may be open or closed. What do you mean by concentric vascular bundles? Vascular bundles are the components of vascular tissue system in plants. The abaxial conducting systems consists of an arc of vascular bundles of different sizes that are circular in outline.
