Getting regular physical activity, especially. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. _______, an element of red blood cells, is responsible for carrying oxygen to tissues in the body. Endurance training can increase your maximal oxygen uptake, or vo2 max, which means your body learns to move and use oxygen with more efficiency during exercise.
