HOW I GOT RID OF CHRONIC BACK PAIN SIMPLE EXERCISE YOU CAN DO AT HOME From youtube.com
For some people, exercising 20 minutes a day could relieve chest pain more effectively than an angioplasty with stents. Stopping smoking, losing weight if needed, and lowering high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar can help control angina. Regular exercise improves your body’s ability to take in and use oxygen, which means you can do daily activities more easily and feel less tired. In fact, a certain amount of regular exercise may help develop new blood vessels to the area of the heart with blocked arteries.
