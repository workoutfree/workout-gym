<p>The cardiac enzymes that doctors measure to see if a person is having a heart attack include troponin t (tnt) and troponin i (tni). Elevations of cardiac enzyme levels should be interpreted in the context of clinical and ecg findings [ 1]. The biomarkers used back then are not clinically relevant today as more sensitive and specific biomarkers have replaced them.

<p>Post heart attack, these enzymes level rises abnormally because of the damage. They are tested when myocardial infarction (mi) is suspected.
