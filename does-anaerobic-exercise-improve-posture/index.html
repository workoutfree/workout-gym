During aerobic workouts, oxygen is flowing through the body and to the muscles which result in the production of more blood vessels (to carry that oxygen). Anaerobic exercise is a type of physical load that helps the athletes increase their speed, strength, and endurance. Anaerobic activity (like strength training) can increase the strength and density of bones, decreasing the risk of osteoporosis.; Weight training also provokes an anaerobic response, provided you use weights that challenge your muscles’ maximum strength.
