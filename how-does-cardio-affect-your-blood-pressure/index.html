<h3 id="treatment-of-hypertension-may-reduce-the-risk-of-heart">Treatment Of Hypertension May Reduce The Risk Of Heart.</h3><p>Any component causing the cardiac output to rise, by increasing the heart rate or stroke volume both, leads to an elevation in the blood. Blood pressure is a measure of how much force is exerted on the walls of your arteries when blood flows. Cardiac output is made up of two components. Cardiac output (co) is the volume of flow of blood from the heart all through ventricles.</p>

The cardiac output increase is due to a large increase in heart rate and a small increase in stroke volume. This can lead to irreversible damage of the heart muscle.</p>
