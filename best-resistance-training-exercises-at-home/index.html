Resistance exercise is the best way to slow down the loss of muscle strength that occurs with aging, and i believe that everyone should do some type of resistance exercise (moving your muscles against an opposing force) as part of their regular exercise program. Workouts like hip hinges, lunges, pushups, and squats strengthen broad muscle groups while working your joints. They’re especially beneficial for those over the age of 40. This move will smoke your shoulders whether you add weight or go without, and the constant tension will recruit more muscle fibres for faster growth.
