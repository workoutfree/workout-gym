<p>High sensitivity troponin can enable ruling out enzymatic elevation very early after pci and facilitate discharge timing. Cardiac troponins t and i are the preferred markers for myocardial injury as they have the highest sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [ 1]. For this reason, cardiac enzyme tests are typically repeated four to six hours later. Because the heart is the only organ that makes troponin, a biomarker test for this enzyme is the primary test healthcare providers use to detect heart damage from a heart attack or acs.

There are two types of troponin that can be measured from a blood sample: Cardiac enzyme tests are a lagging indicator and can take hours to show up in the blood after a heart attack has started, he adds. The role of troponin testing in primary care Best tests December 2009.</p>

<p>During heart attack the rise is significant. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle. Elevated heart enzymes may show that you have cardiovascular disease or other heart problems. The cardiac enzyme test gives you a number measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml).

<p>âif a patient has cardiac enzymes tested soon after a heart attack starts, levels are often normal. Basically lack of oxygenation (ischemia) to cardiac muscles is the cause for rise in enzymes. For this reason, cardiac enzyme tests are typically repeated four to six hours later. At times the values of the cardiac enzyme blood test may rise or go down.
