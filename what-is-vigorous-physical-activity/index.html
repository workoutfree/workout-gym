How Vigorous Exercise Can Greatly Reduce Your Risk of Cancer and Heart From teddyfeed.com
Vigorous physical activity produces large increases in breathing or heart rate, such as jogging, aerobic dance or bicycling uphill. Physical activity of all kinds can be performed in a variety of intensities, ranging between light, moderate, and vigorous (high) intensity activity. Moderate to vigorous physical activities (mvpa) cause an increase in heart rate, breathing, and body temperature. Intensity of exercise is the most elusive of these elements and yet has important implications for the health benefits and particularly cardiovascular outcomes elicited by regular physical activity.
