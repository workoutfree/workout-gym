<p>Doing a lot of zone 2 for recovery may well detract from your capacity to do the more valuable training above the anaerobic threshold. That’s why it’s been touted for decades as the guts of the one mythical. Because i don't have a huge amount of time to train, i try to do 2 or 3 90 minute midweek training sessions in mid zone 4 upwards, and then do a long ride at the weekend.

<p>Running in zone 3 is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in the heart and skeletal muscles. They gained prominence in noted running coach jack daniels’ book “daniel’s running formula”.

<p>Clients should target these zones in between high intensity cardio or resistance training days. Because of this zone 3 fitness, moderate zone 2 riding (which is where 90 percent of any cyclists' training should ideally be), feels ridiculously easy. Get more specific with your training.
