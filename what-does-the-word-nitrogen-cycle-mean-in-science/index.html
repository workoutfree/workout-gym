When animals eat the plants, they acquire usable nitrogen compounds. The nitrogen cycle involves specialized bacteria. It is the process in which nitrogen is transformed to its various chemical forms through biological and physical processes. Nitrogen cycle definition, the continuous sequence of events by which atmospheric nitrogen and nitrogenous compounds in the soil are converted, as by nitrification and nitrogen fixation, into substances that can be utilized by green plants, the substances returning to the air and soil as a result of the decay of the plants and denitrification.

<p>Nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical process through which nitrogen is converted into many forms, consecutively passing from the atmosphere to the soil to organism and back into the atmosphere. Now let us discuss the various steps of nitrogen cycle in detail. The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among atmosperic, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems.the conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. It involves several processes such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, decay and putrefaction. NutrientCycleWebquest[1] ammended.</p>

<p>What is the nitrogen cycle? All living organisms use nitrogen to produce organic substances including amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids. The nitrogen cycle is the biochemical cycle through which nitrogen is converted to various forms as it passes from the atmosphere to the soil and eventually to marine and terrestrial plants. Plants convert this nitrogen into plant proteins. Magh Ag Sci Soil Wordcloud.</p>

<p>Now let us discuss the various steps of nitrogen cycle in detail. When animals eat the plants, they acquire usable nitrogen compounds. The cyclic process by which nitrogen as in the atmosphere is transmitted from air to soil, from soil to plants, from plants to animals, and finally from organisms to the atmosphere and maintains the balance of nitrogen in the environment is called the nitrogen cycle (3).

<p>The nitrogen cycle is the succession of biochemical processes and changes through which nitrogen is used by living bodies and then released at the time of death and decomposition of the bodies, then returned to its initial oxidised state. Very simply when scientists talk about cycles they are talking about sequences of events that repeat themselves. In nitrogen fixation, bacteria convert into ammonia, a form of nitrogen usable by plants. What is the meaning of cycle in science? Nitrogen Cycle Nitrogen cycle, Hydrological cycle, Nitrogen.</p>

<p>A limiting nutrient is the nutrient that's in shortest supply and limits growth. The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among atmosperic, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems.the conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. The cyclic process by which nitrogen as in the atmosphere is transmitted from air to soil, from soil to plants, from plants to animals, and finally from organisms to the atmosphere and maintains the balance of nitrogen in the environment is called the nitrogen cycle (3). Like the carbon cycle or the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle describes how nitrogen is converted into different forms as it moves through the cycle. The Earth's Spheres CK12 Foundation.</p>
