<p>A cardiac enzyme test is one means for assessing if a person is currently experiencing or recently had a heart attack. Heart enzymes are often measured if your doctor suspects heart damage, such as the kind that occurs after a heart attack. This test checks for levels of enzymes that are released by the heart muscle when it is injured, such as during a heart attack. This tells your doctor how much of the enzyme is in your blood.</p>
