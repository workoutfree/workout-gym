Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place. You can use light weights to perform cardio workouts, but if you can continue to perform weighted exercises for 30 minutes with dumbbells, for example, the weights are too light to build much muscle mass. In these cases, other energy sources must be used. Trainers and fitness experts advise adding interval training to your regular cardio workout to expedite your weight loss.
