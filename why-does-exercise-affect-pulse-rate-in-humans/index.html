Why It’s Important to Breathe Correctly While You Exercise Diet From indiatimes.com
During exercise there is an increase in physical activity and muscle cells respire more than they do when the body is at rest. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. Your heart rate rises and your pulse quickens, showing that your cardiovascular system is active. The simple answer is that oxygen comes from blood.

<p>An experiment write up on how exercise affects heart rate. Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat — which means it doesn't have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise. This will mean that the ph of the blood will also increase; When animals exercise they have an increased requirement for oxygen and respiratory substrate delivery to the muscles and carbon dioxide delivery to the lungs, due to rising rates of respiration in the muscle cells to provide the atp needed for muscular contraction.
