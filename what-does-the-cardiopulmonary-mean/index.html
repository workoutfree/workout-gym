Failure of the ventricles of the heart to contract (usually caused by ventricular fibrillation) with consequent absence of the heart beat leading to oxygen lack and eventually to death. For example, when the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently, normal oxygen movement in the lungs is reduced, causing shortness of breath. The most common electrical mechanism which is responsible for 50 to 80% of cardiopulmonary arrest is ventricular fibrillation (vf). What does cardiopulmonary arrest mean?
