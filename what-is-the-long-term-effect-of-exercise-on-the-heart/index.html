Lesson 2 long term effects of exercise From slideshare.net
Q during exercise = 24 l. The most common causes of hypertrophy are related to increased blood pressure in either the lungs or the body. Your heart, which is a muscular organ, gets a workout. Observational trials are problematic because without randomizing the groups and controlling all the trial’s factors, one cannot determine cause and effect.

<p>At the onset of exercise your muscles signal your heart to pump faster for increased blood flow. The rise in maximal cardiac output is due to increases in maximal stroke volume. One of the most touted benefits of exercise is that it helps to reduce blood pressure. In simple terms, blood pressure refers to the pressure of blood circulating in your blood vessels.

The most common causes of hypertrophy are related to increased blood pressure in either the lungs or the body. The rise in maximal cardiac output is due to increases in maximal stroke volume.

<p>What happens to your heart when you start to exercise? The size of the heart and the strength of the cardiac muscle increases due to regular exercises as to the maximum extent the left ventricle adapts. But doing regular exercise also sets you up to stay healthier for longer in later life. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. cardiovascular response to acute exercise YouTube.</p>

<p>The most common causes of hypertrophy are related to increased blood pressure in either the lungs or the body. Exercise did not significantly impact myocyte remodeling or ventricular function in control animals. The extra work of pumping blood against the increased pressure causes the ventricle to thicken over time, the same way a body muscle increases in mass. The heart eventually becomes more efficient, and no longer needs to beat as quickly to supply the body with blood while at rest. Adaptations to long term exercise Cardiovascular System HubPages.</p>
