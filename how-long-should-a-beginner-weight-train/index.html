How long is a barbell From onettechnologiesindia.com
If you are lifting weights any longer than an hour, you’re basically wasting your time since your natural hormones, like testosterone, begin to drop after this amount of time. This is what works best for beginners. Weight training results are almost instant, although you may not see the results as quickly as they are happening. How long you lift weights per session will depend on your fitness level, goal and how many days you&#39;re training per week.
