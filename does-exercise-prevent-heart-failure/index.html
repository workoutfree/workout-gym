How Does Aerobic Exercise Help Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases From lisbonlx.com
People at risk for heart disease often struggle with the uncertainty of knowing whether their arteries contain fatty plaque that might cause a heart attack. Animal studies suggest that ischemic preconditioning seems to protect the heart if a heart attack does occur later on, reducing damage by as much as 50%. Epidemiological studies have left no doubt as to the existence of a strong inverse relationship between physical exercise and coronary heart disease (chd) risk. Regular exercise is safe for heart failure patients, improves their quality of life and may slightly lower their risk of death or hospitalization, according to a new study.
