Proximal left anterior descending (lad) coronary artery disease is considered as a high‐risk feature in interventional cardiology attributable to the large area of myocardium it supplies.

An lvad restores blood flow to a person whose heart has been weakened by heart disease. Results from the eraci ii study. From there, it travels around the left side of the pulmonary artery (pa) and passes into the epicardial fat obliquely in the direction of the apex of the heart in the anterior interventricular sulcus. Often, fatty deposits and other blockages settle in the vessels around the heart due to heart disease.
