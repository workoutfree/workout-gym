<p>The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax. The cardiac cycle consists of the events in the heart from the start of one heartbeat to the start of the next. (phase analysis, nci thesaurus) the electrical axis of the heart is a term used to describe the mean direction and magnitude of electrical impulses generated by the heart during the cardiac cycle. Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart.</p>

<p>Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Broadly, the cardiac cycle passes through two phases: Heart, cardiac cycle the muscular contractions that squeeze blood through the chambers of the heart and around the blood circulatory system.
