<meta name="description" content="The 23 Step What Is Cardiac Cycle Explain With Diagram Ideas, The human heart is healthy and beats at a rate of 72 times per minute, which means 72 cycles of the heart per minute. The cardiac cycle is the series of contractions in the heart that pressurize different chambers, causing blood to flood in one direction.
4 Phases Of The Cardiac Cycle slideshare From slidesharenow.blogspot.com
It starts at the beginning of one heartbeat and ends at the beginning of another. The relaxed heart allows for blood to fill the cardiac chambers. This is the time required for one complete cardiac cycle. The duration of the cardiac cycle is inversely proportional to the heart rate.

<p>The cardiac cycle is the series of contractions in the heart that pressurize different chambers, causing blood to flood in one direction. Diastole is defined as the phase in which the heart, especially the ventricles, is at rest. The process begins as early as the 4th gestational week when the heart first begins contracting. With the normal heart rate of 75 per minute, this time will be 60/75 = 0.8 sec. Phases Of Cardiac Cycle sharedoc.</p>

<p>At a normal heart rate of 75 beats per minute, one cardiac cycle lasts 0.8 second. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart, beginning from one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Hence when the heart rate is increased to 120 beats per minute, the cardiac cycle duration will be about. The cardiac cycle duration increases with a decrease in the heart rate and on the other hand it shortens with increasing heart rate. Cardiac Cycle.</p>
