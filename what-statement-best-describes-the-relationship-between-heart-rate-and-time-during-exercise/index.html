Exercise directly affects the activity, function and health of your heart. As your cardiovascular fitness improves, the level of heart rate increase necessary during strenuous physical. The graph represents a person's heart rate in beats per minute during 30 minutes of exercise. â«Ú©Ø§Ø±Ø¨Ø±Ø¯Û ØªØ±ÛÙ ÙØºØ§Øª Ø§ÙÚ¯ÙÛØ³Û !!! 1 is Ø§Ø³Øª 2 be Ø¨ÙØ¯Ù 3 and Ù 4 of Ø§Ø² 5.</p>
