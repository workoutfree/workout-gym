<p>Two burger king whoppers with cheese contain 1,446 calories. Now that we have examined the variables, we can think about how to more effectively answer the question of how much exercise we need per day to lose weight.

<p>Conversely, if you goal is to lose 30 pounds in two months, the equation is radically different. Then we multiply that by 1.6 to account for the additional calories you burn from a day’s worth of average physical activity for a total of 2400 calories per day. This 300 minutes is equivalent to exercising for an hour, five days a week. Consider that creating a daily energy deficit of 500 calories will result in 1 pound weight loss per week (all things being equal) then a daily exercise session of 45 minutes will result in 1 1/2 pounds weight loss per week.
