The mode of delivery of acute cardiac care is important. Purpose to assess the efficacy of coronary computed tomographic (ct) angiography for therapeutic decision making in patients with high likelihood of coronary artery disease (cad)—specifically the ability of coronary ct angiography to help differentiate patients without and patients with a need for revascularization and determine the appropriate. This prospective multicenter registry evaluated 689 symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (cad) undergoing serial coronary computed tomography. Some units no longer admit stemi patients, while in ppci centres the concentrated influx of patients previously treated.
