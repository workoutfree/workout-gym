HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE DURING PANDEMIC? From powermaxfitness.net
Subjects were equally divided into two groups as experimental and control. The effects of aerobic exercise can be an effective way to increase the endurance of your cardiorespiratory system. However, if the respiratory muscles become stronger and more efficient as a result of respiratory muscle training, they will need less energy, oxygen and blood to support a specific exercise intensity. Triathlon is an aerobic sport, i.e.
