Stenting of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection From a Pathological From ahajournals.org
Arterial elasticity is modulated by endothelial function. This buildup is called plaque. Of the subjects, 168 (41%) reported one or more cardiovascular events. Atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries or stiffening of the arteries) is a disease of the blood vessels (the arteries) that carry blood and oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body.

Atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries or stiffening of the arteries) is a disease of the blood vessels (the arteries) that carry blood and oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body. Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) become hardened and narrowed.
