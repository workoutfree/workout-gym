Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood. As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart&#39;s arteries to dilate more readily. This process is measured by a term called “cardiac output,” which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute.

<p>The second heart may exhaust, whereas the healthy heart becomes stronger with a lower resting heart rate. Effective exercise occurs when the lungs, heart and muscles work harder together. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. When we exercise at a high intensity, the heart reaches its maximum heart rate (hrmax), which is capable of beating very fast.</p>

<p>The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. Now that takes us to the point why the heart rate increase during exercise. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms).

<p>The american heart association (aha) recommends doing exercise that increases a person's heart rate to between 50 to 85 percent of their maximum heart rate. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases. The more intense the exercise, the higher the heart rate. Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels.

<p>Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood. Heart rate and exercise intensity share a direct, linear relationship: When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress.
