The function of the cardiac sphincter is to prevent a back flow of materials back into the esophagus. The internal anal sphincter is a thickened extension of the circular smooth muscle layer surrounding the colon and is generally considered responsible for maintaining approximately 70% of resting tone, ensuring that the anal canal is closed at rest.
